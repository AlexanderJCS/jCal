# jCal
A calendar application that I made to compare my school schedules with my friends'. Made using my graphics library / game engine, JANGL.

This project is considered completed, and will not receive frequent updates.

## Usage

### Adding or Removing Calendars to Compare

The program starts with the first three calendars in alphabetical order selected. You can add or remove more calendars by clicking the checkboxes next to the calendar names.

### Shared Events

You can see the events that are shared across classes by clicking the "Shared" button.  When clicked, only events that all selected calendars share are displayed.

This is useful for finding classes that you share with your friends.

### Adding More Calendars / Schedules

You can add another calendar (a.k.a. schedule) to the list by creating a new `.jcal` file in [the calendar directory](resources/calendars).

You can look at existing calendars for examples on how to create new ones.
